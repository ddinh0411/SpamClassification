Name: Daniel Dinh
Class: CPSC 393 (Machine Learning)
Assignment: HW 2

Resources Used:
- Asked Samuel B. for help with the accuracies and knowing what loss function to use during the Neural Network
- Collaborated with Sreya & Sarah F. to double check what valid values would be for both loss and accuracy to have an idea if the accuracies I ended with were valid
- https://keras.io/api/layers/activations/ (Used for figuring out which activation layer to use)
- https://keras.io/api/layers/regularizers/ (Used to determine what regularizers I should have within the NN)
- Classwork
